> Data Analytics Developer at Teads ( http://www.teads.tv )
Arvydas has been working with open-source technologies as a back-end enterprise software developer for 10+ years.His experience with Cassandra, in both dev and ops roles, dates back to the early days (since 2010, v0.5.5).He has worked at both startups and larger organizations in the Los Angeles area, aka "Silicon Beach", before recently moving to Montpellier.

## Using monitoring to understand Cassandra

Let’s be honest, nobody cares about a fire extinguisher until their house is burning down. In a similar vein, monitoring is an important, yet often undervalued part of running production systems. Distributed databases internals are often complex. Cassandra is not an exception and might sometimes be tricky to understand correctly.

In this presentation Alain will demystify Cassandra internals and demonstrate how monitoring can be used to solve the difficult problems that are unique to distributed databases. We’ll explore the options available to empower every operator running this powerful database. Audience members will walk away with a an excellent understanding of how a well thought out monitoring solution can save them from countless hours of tedious debugging and business impacting performance issues and downtime.

Audience:

This is appropriate for anyone interested in running a healthy distributed system, especially an Apache Cassandra cluster.

Benefits to the Ecosystem:

This presentation aims at two main things:

- Proving the importance of monitoring to have some visibility and to understand internals of the system being monitored.

- Presenting some Cassandra internals, so people can understand if it would be a good fit for their own use cases.

Technical Requirements:

Attendees will benefit from some experience running production databases, but it’s not required. This talk will assume a basic understanding of operational hazards in production environments.

> Alain has been working with Apache Cassandra since version 0.8. He was the first Engineer at http://teads.tv which had grown to 400+ employees by the time he left.
During his time at Teads Alain managed and scaled Cassandra clusters across multiple AWS Regions. His experience with Cassandra from the early days has included upgrading hardware, growing capacity, upgrading, and tuning all the time maintaining Availability. He also evolved data models to take advantage of the latest features and performance as Cassandra improved.

Since January 2016, Alain is working with many companies as a consultant on Apache Cassandra for The Last Pickle. Alain also value the community work and regularly present talks (Cassandra Summit, ApacheCon, Meetup) and frequently contributes to the Apache Cassandra users mailing list.
